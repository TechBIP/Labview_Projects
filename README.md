## Experiments

### 1. Amplitude Shift Keying - Method 1
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to transmit digital data. Method 1 refers to a specific approach in ASK modulation, and this experiment explores its implementation in LabVIEW.

### 2. Amplitude Shift Keying - Method 2
Similar to Method 1, this experiment focuses on Amplitude Shift Keying but utilizes a different method for modulation. Understanding the nuances of different methods in ASK modulation is crucial for signal processing applications.

### 3. Binary Phase Shift Keying
Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) is a type of digital modulation where the phase of the carrier signal is altered to represent binary data. This experiment demonstrates the LabVIEW implementation of BPSK modulation.

### 4. Double Side Band Amplitude Modulation
Double Side Band Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM) involves modulating both the upper and lower sidebands of a carrier signal. In this experiment, LabVIEW is used to showcase the principles and implementation of DSB-AM.

### 5. Double Side Band Amplitude Demodulation
This experiment focuses on demodulating a Double Side Band Amplitude Modulated signal. Understanding the process of recovering the original signal from the modulated waveform is vital in communication systems.

### 6. Double Side Band Suppressed Carrier
DSB-SC is a modulation technique where the carrier signal is suppressed. This experiment in LabVIEW demonstrates the implementation of DSB-SC modulation, highlighting its applications in certain communication scenarios.

### 7. Frequency Shift Keying - Method 1
Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) involves changing the frequency of the carrier signal to represent digital data. Method 1 in this experiment explores a specific approach to FSK modulation using LabVIEW.

### 8. Frequency Shift Keying - Method 2
Similar to the previous experiment, this one focuses on Frequency Shift Keying but uses a different method for modulation. Exploring multiple methods enhances the understanding of FSK modulation techniques.

### 9. Pulse Amplitude Modulation
Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) is a form of signal modulation where the amplitude of a series of signal pulses is varied. This LabVIEW experiment delves into the principles and implementation of PAM for digital data transmission.

### 10. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)
QPSK is a more advanced form of Phase Shift Keying that involves four different phase shifts to represent digital data. This experiment in LabVIEW demonstrates the intricacies of implementing QPSK modulation for communication systems.
