## Experiments

### 1. Amplitude Shift Keying - Method 1
[Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) is a digital modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to transmit digital data. Method 1 refers to a specific approach in ASK modulation, and this experiment explores its implementation in LabVIEW.]
